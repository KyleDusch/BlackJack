# BlackJack
A Blackjack game using Python and Tkinter. Features 2 Players, A betting system, also contains a basic GUI (Graphical User Interface). The game pulls from a cards folder within the domain and draws specifically .png files (for higher quality images than a jpeg file).  Chat GPT was used to help make the play again feature more efficient as the framework I initially tested was a lot more prone to errors of an experience. ChatGPT provided several suggestions that were efficient.

The genesis of the project was from the first ever course I took on udemy which was a 65 hour python course. I improved by adding a betting system and the feature of 2 players. I enjoyed researching the specific problem on stackoverflow (such as how to build a two person system in tkinter and Python) and then integrating into my code and debugging the code. 

There are more improvements to be made, but the game is extremely fun and enjoyable to play in some downtime. The next improvements would be to try smooth out the user experience and debug the code more. Also asking more people to play the game and potentially trying to upload the game to a webpage with Flask. Lastly, add a button that allows users to enter name and then randomly picks whom gets to go first.
