# BlackJack
A Blackjack game using Python and Tkinter. Features 2 Players, A betting system, also contains a basic GUI (Graphical User Interface). The game pulls from a cards folder within the domain and draws specifically .png files.  Chat GPT used to help add the function of play again.

The genesis of the project was from the first ever course I took on udemy which was a 60 hour python course. I improved by adding a betting system and the feature of 2 players. I enjoyed researching the specific hows on stackoverflow and then integrating into my code and debugging the code. I definitely have more improvements to be made, but extremely fun and enjoyable to play blackjack in some downtime.
